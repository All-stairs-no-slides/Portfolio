It is a game inspired by the game rumble, and your only move is hustle.", "This is a game that I created so that I could use water bending in combat. Within it I simulated water vioa multiple liquid particles drawn on the same layer with slight transparency. within it you throw liquid at enemies, with damage done to the enemy being calculated by the velocity of the particles. You can also use the liuquids creatively to for instance ride on them to get around the map. particles also interact with other p[articles, with water and lava touching to create rock."]
