				"For our continuation is a game that I created with the gamemaker engine. It was created for the Pirate Software 14 game jam. While is was started during said game jam it was too ambitious for a game jam that I did by myself and as such it was not submitted due to it not being completed. I have hgowever, hcontinued development after said game jam.",
				"This game is a rogue like that takes inspiration from games such as enter the gungeon. As such the player traverses several generated rooms, defeating enemies and increasing their power. The main idea behind this game was to create one in which the enemies adapt to the player using a machine learning model. This hasn't yet been implemented, however, the basis for it to occur has. The enemies are all modeular, meaning that they are made up of a body, legs and weapons. Each of these features change their stats. At the moment these body parts are chosen at random however, I am currently adding a way for proximity to projectiles to be stored so they can train a ML model that will assign the body parts instead.",
