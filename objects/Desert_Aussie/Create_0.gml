It is not an example of how refined of a project I can create as sI made it within the pweeriod of a week and is instead an example of the fact that I can output 0a finioshed result for a task even in highgly constrained time periods. The pursuing pixels 3 game jam is one that occured over 1 wek in the jume of 2024. It had the theme of parallel. To follow this theme I created a side scroller game with a split screen where the player would control 2 characters at the same time and avoid obstacles to get a score. This game jam is one that I participated in myself.", "This game is one that was inspired by side scroller games such as flappy bird or jetpack joyride. It is a simple game in which the player has a set amount of lives that reduce upon collision with an enemy, and as such the players main goal is to avoid them. The enemies in of themselves had some simple behaviours, however, nothing too impressive, due to the time constrains.", "efficient operation within a constrained time limit"]
